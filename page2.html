                <h1>Florence</h1>
                <p>Welcome to Florence, home of pasta and wine (which is a great plus since us freshmen are always under21).
                  Luckily, here no one cares about the drinking age! Here you will find the seeminly amazing "Italian Stallions"
                  but in reality, clubs are filled with old creeps preying on young study abroad students. And of course, the plus of
                  studying in NYU Florence is the beautiful campus and daily "hike" to the classrooms. In reality, it is a five
                  minute walk that goes both down and up, which everyone calls "The Valley of Death."</p>

                <h1>London</h1>
                <p>Welcome to London! Home of Sherlock Holmes and the Beatles. This seemingly cold and rainy place is much indeed cold and rainy.
                The plus of this campus is the fact that there is no campus, just like in NYU New York! However, don't be alarmed, London still has
                a lot to offer. London is one of the two global sites that hosts first year Liberal Study students that don't require them to take
                a 6 credit language course. Instead, you are forced to take Economics. Now, who doesn't love Econ. I know I sure do :)</p>

                <p>Welcome to Madrid! One of the new global sites that is offered for first year abroad students. One of the better sites just because
                  of location. (And you can live out your dreams after watching the show Elite on Netflix) This is also a prime spot for those who choose
                  to study abroad in junior year for Global Liberal Studies majors. Not to mention, this is a great time to finally put that high school spanish
                  into use.  </p>

                <h1>Paris</h1>
                <p>Welcome to Paris! Home of the Eiffel Tower and croissants. This site offers a site with great sightseeing opportunities. Not only can you hustle your way into the Lourve for
                  free on Fridays, you can also visit the unfortunate falling of the Notre Dame. This site has one of the smaller amounts of freshmen which
                  means the perfect opportunity to learn everybody's name! (And a higher chance of being student body president)</p>

                <h1>Washington D.C. </h1>
                <p>Washington D.C.! Who wouldn't want to spend their freshmen year in the study abroad location all the way in Washington D.C. This is a great
                spot for students who are not very good at languages. Every class and every teacher uses english! Perfect time to immerse yourself in the fast-paced
                world of American government. </p>
