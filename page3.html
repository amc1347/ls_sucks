                <h1><a>Q1: What is Liberal Studies?</a></h1>
                <p> Well to be quite honest with you, it is a two year program which allows you to get a Associates Degree.
                  However, LS is only particularly helpful if you want to transfer into the College of Arts and Science. There are only
                  a couple of majors in the other schools that are a direct transfer. All the other majors are majors that you must apply for.</p>

                <h1><a>Q2: Is there an application for Liberal Studies? I don't remember applying for it.</a></h1>
                <p>There was an "application," technically in the common application, there is a little two question dropdown menu
                  that asks if you would like to be placed into the Liberal Studies program if selected. But most of the time, no
                  we did not apply to be in LS.</p>

                <h1><a>Q3: Which is the best location to pick?</a></h1>
                <p>In my professional opinion, any site that is not in the United States is a good one. </p>

                <h1><a>Q4: What happens if you realize that you did not mean to apply to LS?</a></h1>
                <p>As someone who did exactly that, I made some of the best friends by accidently selecting the LS item. It gave me enough
                 time to figure out what major I wanted and I saved a lot of money by not needing to purchase a fake id and because wine
                 in Florence is a lot cheaper. </p>

                <h1><a>Q5: Is there any way you can get out of LS?</a></h1>
                <p>Well, I heard along the grapevine that someone who was put into LS in Madrid managed to get out of it and go to the New York Campus
                  due to an "injury".</p>
