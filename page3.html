                <p>As someone who did exactly that, I made some of the best friends by accidently selecting the LS item. It gave me enough
                 time to figure out what major I wanted and I saved a lot of money by not needing to purchase a fake id and because wine
                 in Florence is a lot cheaper.</p>

                <h1><a>Q2: Is there an application for Liberal Studies? I don't remember applying for it.</a></h1>
                <p>There was an "application," technically in the common application, there is a little two question dropdown menu
                  that asks if you would like to be placed into the Liberal Studies program if selected. But most of the time, no
                  we did not apply to be in LS.</p>

                <h1><a>Q3: Which is the best location to pick?</a></h1>
                <p>In my professional opinion, every single site has their pros and their cons. But I do think it is hard for people who have just entered
                  college to live with only 100 other people. >

                <p>Well, I heard along the grapevine that someone who was put into LS in Madrid managed to get out of it and go to the New York Campus
                  due to an "injury".</p>
